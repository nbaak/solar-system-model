Model of the Solar System in Python

## why making a model of the solar system?
It was a test if <a href="https://chat.openai.com">ChatGPT</a> could create a animated model of the solar system with python. The result wasn't bad but the AI had big provlems fixing the scaling.

## conclusion
The AI is a great way to support programmers but it can't do all the work alone (yet). I'm sure that AI will get better in the future and can do trivial things like this completely alone.
